# Abalone Age Prediction: A Supervised Machine Learning Approach

This project presents a supervised machine learning model aimed at predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements.

### Repository Contents

## How it's Made
The analysis utilizes **Multiple Linear Regression**, a supervised learning technique, to predict abalone age. The project is structured as follows:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** 
- **Data Preprocessing:** Before modeling, data cleaning was conducted by checking for missing values and independence among measurements. Variable scaling was applied to address the skewed distribution of the target variable (rings/age).
- **Model Development:**
  - **Original Model:** Includes all predictors, providing a baseline for performance comparison.
  - **Live Abalone Model:** Excludes post-mortem measurements, focusing on predictors obtainable from living abalone.

- **Model Selection via AIC Minimization:** I applied both forward and backward stepwise regression, guided by the AIC, to identify the most informative subset of predictors while avoiding overfitting.

## Testing and Validation
- **Assumption Checks**
- **Performance Metrics:** The models were evaluated based on RÂ² (explained variance), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error), with cross-validation to assess generalizability.

## Lessons Learned
- **Ethical Data Science:** The importance of considering ethical implications in model selection and data collection.
- **Supervised Learning:** Demonstrated the potential of linear regression and AIC minimization in ecological research.
- **Trade-offs in Model Complexity:** Explored the balance between model accuracy and simplicity, emphasizing the value of non-invasive predictors.
